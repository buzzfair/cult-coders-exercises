EXERCISE 1

You have a file structure that begins looking like this:

📁ROOT
    file0.txt
    file1.txt
    
where your current working directory begins at ./ROOT

The following commands are executed in the command line:

touch file2.txt
mkdir level1
cd level1
mkdir level2
mkdir level3

Now, draw the resulting file structure and an arrow indicating where the current working directory is located.
